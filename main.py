#| Hello thanks for looking over my simple python project |
#| this was done so i can refresh my pyhton skils for this|
#| project i used OOP way of programing maybe i will      |
#| with FP programing idk                                 |
#| Originaly i wanted to have one big .py class file i    |
#| split them because i think this is more scalabel way   |
#| i know this isnt big project but still is something    |
#| recources.py for conviniece purpose this wasnt made to |
#| this code isnt perfect many issues but i couldnt be    |
#| bothered to make it something realy good               |
